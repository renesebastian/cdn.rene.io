## Not a real changelog but still:
Somewhat adjusted codebase to serve as a CDN for [rene.io](https://www.rene.io) and [renesebastian.nl](https://www.renesebastian.nl). Nothing special, check original repo for all it's functions. 

- Optimized to run as a CDN
- Stripped clean of unnecessary code and files
- Did some error messaging adjustments
